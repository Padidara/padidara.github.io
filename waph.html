  <h3>Overview of lab0</h3>
  <p>This lab is covered in Lecture 2, with preparation homework in Lecture 1. In Part I, we deployed an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on the provided online environment and installed all the required software and applications which mentioned in lecture. In Part II, we cloned the course repository and private repository and completed git exercises to write the report.</p>
  <p>Lab1 repository link: <a href="https://github.com/Padidara/waph-padidara/tree/main/labs/lab1">lab1 repository link</a></p>
  <h3>Overview of lab1</h3>
  <p>Completing Lab 1 of the WAPH course gave a basic understanding of web technology. It addressed how to use Wireshark to analyze HTTP traffic, how to explore HTTP protocol intricacies using telnet, and how to design web applications. Among them were CGI programs and a simple PHP web application that processed user input. The lab also covered HTTP GET and POST requests, which are necessary for dynamic websites to function. Participants learned critical skills in protocol analysis and web development, as well as a thorough understanding of essential principles in HTTP communication.</p>

  <h3>Overview of lab2</h3>
  <p>Created a new folder "lab2" under "labs" flders and created the "waph-padidara.html" file using the 'subl wap-padidara.html' command in the terminal and performed all the tasks in this file which are mentioned in the assignement. Then by using "sudo cp waph-padidara.html /var/www/html" command to deploy to the web page to see the output on the webpage.Then i took all the neccesary screenshots and and in the README.md file i have added the screenshots and by using pandoc converted to pdf. This lab covered some bsic fundamentals of HTML, some basic tags, and using Ajax to make websites interactive and dynamic without having to reload the whole page, CSS for styling and explore jQuery, a tool that helps make JavaScript coding simpler and more efficient.And used Fetch() command to fetch the api data</p>
  <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
  <p>This hackathon seeks to raise awareness about XSS attacks, understand code vulnerabilities, and adopt secure coding methods that follow OWASP principles to protect against cross-site scripting attacks. There are two tasks in the lab. Task 1 is to attack the URL http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/, which contains six levels of vulnerabilities. Task 2 focuses on preventing XSS attacks using secure coding standards such as input validation and output sanitization.</p>
